# Automated File Sorter
Here, I am using python to automate the process of finding files and sorting them into folders based on their file type using several for loops and if/elif statements.

I created csv, json, and xlsx datasets using https://www.mockaroo.com/. This site is pretty incredible, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else.
